### DESCRIPTION
Currently the dataset (Version 4) is constructed by choosing 8 largest classes : "Circle", "Kite", "Parallelogram", "Square", "Rectangle", "Rhombus", "Trapezoid", and "Triangle". Each class contains 1,500 training samples, 500 validation samples, and 500 test samples. The total number of training samples is 12,000, validation samples 4,000, and testing 4,000. Each sample is an image measuring (224 x 224 x 3) (RGB).
