# `tools.py` Documentation

This script, `tools.py`, provides a suite of utility functions designed to facilitate the development, training, and evaluation processes in deep learning projects. It encompasses functionalities for handling JSON files, ensuring reproducibility through seeding, environmental diagnostics, and model architecture analysis. These utilities are crafted to streamline workflows, enhance consistency across experimental setups, and support in-depth analysis and optimization of deep learning models.

## Functions Overview

- `read_json(fname)`: Load a JSON file into an ordered dictionary.
- `write_json(content, fname)`: Write data to a JSON file, maintaining the order of keys.
- `seed_all(seed)`: Seed all random number generators to ensure experiment reproducibility.
- `print_env()`: Print detailed information about the current experimental environment, including hardware and software configurations.
- `compute_output_dim(model, input_shape)`: Calculate the output dimensions of a model given a specific input size, useful for designing network architectures.
